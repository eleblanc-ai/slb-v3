      "default": "**CORE TASK**\nGenerate 5 multiple choice questions (MCQs) based on the PASSAGE, WRITING PROMPT, VOCAB WORDS, and PRIMARY READING STANDARDS listed below according to the following requirements and rules.\n\n**CRITICAL: STANDARDS REQUIREMENTS**\nUse the primary reading standards to create the MCQs. Standards describe what students should have learned by the end of a course or grade.\n   1. **IMPORTANT: ALL questions MUST comply with the provided standards ONLY. DO NOT add standards.**\n      - You MUST use each PRIMARY READING STANDARD at least ONCE across all questions.\n      - Every question MUST reference at least ONE PRIMARY READING STANDARD from the list below.\n      - You can use multiple standards for one question (but it is not required).\n   2. Use the the STANDARD STATEMENTS below as starting points to create the MCQs.\n      EXAMPLES:\n      - STANDARD STATEMENT: \"Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language of a court opinion differs from that of a newspaper).\"\n      MCQ: \"Reread the following sentence from the article. 'These included programs for higher wages and aid for people experiencing poverty.' In this sentence, what does the word word 'aid' most likely mean?\"\n      - STANDARD STATEMENT: \"Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, assessing whether the reasoning is valid and the evidence is relevant and sufficient; identify false statements and fallacious reasoning.\"\n      MCQ: \"Which passage from the article best supports the idea that the United States was in competition with the Soviet Union during the Cold War?\"\n   3. List ALL relevant PRIMARY READING STANDARDS under each question (see FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS below).\n      - **ONLY list PRIMARY READING STANDARDS that are relevant to the question. NEVER list ALL of the standards for ONE question. If you paste every provided standard under a single MCQ, your answer will be rejected.**\n      - Include the standard codes in the bracketed list under each question (e.g., [CCSS.RI.6.1; CCSS.RL.6.4]).\n      - Whenever you cite a standard statement that appears for multiple grade-level codes, include every one of those codes in the bracketed list for that question.\n         EXAMPLE: TEKS.ELAR.3.7(C), TEKS.ELAR.4.7(C), and TEKS.ELAR.5.7(C) all have the standard statement, \"use text evidence to support an appropriate response.\"\n\n**RULES**\n   1. All questions MUST be based on the passage (ensure students cannot answer the questions without reading the passage).\n   2. Phrase ALL questions as questions, NOT incomplete sentences (fill in the blank).\n   3. Each question MUST have four answer choices.\n   4. The first question MUST ask about the central idea or main claim of the passage and be phrased according the following template.\n      TEMPLATE (Select ONE word in EACH of the square brackets [ ]): Which [statement/sentence] best [captures/expresses/explains/represents] the [main/central] [claim/idea] of the passage?\n   5. At least one question should ask students to use context clues to determine the meaning of a vocab word (see VOCAB WORDS below). The vocab word MUST be challenging, domain-specific, or multiple-meaning and used in the same context as it is used in the passage.\n   6. Add a brief definition sentence before a question if necessary to help students understand it (e.g. \"Lydia Darragh helped the colonial army. What did she overhear?\").\n   7. Answer choices should be conceptually and grammatically parallel (e.g. A. to bring herself good luck, B. to show that she felt disgusted, C. to leave part of herself in the river, D. to see how fast the river was flowing)\n   8. DO NOT include distractor choices that are not parallel to the others (e.g. A. apples, B. oranges, C. lemons, D. pants).\n   9. Never ask \"would you\" questions (e.g. Which of these statements would you include in an accurate summary of this article?).",
