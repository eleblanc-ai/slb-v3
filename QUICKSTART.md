# Smart Lesson Builder — Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Smart Lesson Builder. This guide walks you through creating, editing, and exporting lessons.

## Signing In

Head to the app URL and sign in with your ThinkCERCA email. If it's your first time, you'll be asked to set a display name — this is how your name appears on lessons you create.

## Home Screen

After signing in, you'll see two main options:

- **Create a New Lesson** — start a lesson from a template
- **Browse Lessons** — find and continue working on existing lessons

## Creating a New Lesson

### 1. Pick a template

Click **Create a New Lesson**. You'll see the available lesson templates organized by type (core templates and state-specific variants). Choose the one that fits your lesson.

### 2. Fill in the setup fields

A guided form will open asking for the information the AI needs before it can generate content — things like topic, grade level, passage text, and standards. Fill in each step and click the arrow to continue.

### 3. Generate your lesson

Once the setup fields are complete, click **Generate Lesson** in the toolbar. The builder will work through each AI-enabled field one at a time. You can watch the progress bar as it goes.

If you need to stop mid-generation, click the pause button. You can resume or regenerate individual fields later.

### 4. Review and edit

Every generated field is fully editable. Click into any field to revise the text, swap out answer choices, or adjust standards. Rich text fields support formatting (bold, italic, headings, etc.) using the toolbar above the editor.

Your work **auto-saves** as you type — you'll see a brief save confirmation when changes are persisted.

### 5. Regenerate a single field

Not happy with one section? Click the **✨ Regenerate Field** on that field to regenerate just that field using AI. You can also open the field's AI settings to adjust the prompt or change which context fields feed into it.

### 6. Preview and export

When your lesson looks good:

- **Preview** (👁 icon) — see a formatted read-only preview of the full lesson
- **Export** (⬇ icon) — download the lesson as a Markdown file, or copy it to your clipboard

If any required fields are still empty, the export modal will let you know what's missing.

## Browsing & Continuing Lessons

Click **Browse Lessons** from the home screen to see all lessons you and your team have created. From here you can:

- **Open a lesson** to keep editing where you left off
- **Copy a shareable link** to the lesson
- **Archive** a lesson you no longer need
- **Delete** a lesson (if you created it)

> **Note:** If someone else is currently editing a lesson, you'll see a lock indicator. The lesson will open in read-only mode until they're done.

## Choosing an AI Model

The toolbar includes a model selector where you can switch between AI providers (Claude, GPT, Gemini). Different models may produce different results — feel free to experiment to find what works best for your content.

## Tips

- **Fill in context fields first.** The AI uses fields like passage text, topic, and grade level to generate everything else. The more complete your inputs, the better the output.
- **Use the pre-form wizard.** It walks you through exactly what's needed before generation — don't skip it.
- **Edit freely after generation.** AI output is a starting point. Adjust tone, fix details, and add your expertise.
- **Auto-save has your back.** Changes save automatically, but you can also click the save icon in the toolbar anytime.
- **Export uses the Content ID as the filename** when one is set, so your downloads stay organized.
